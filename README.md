# Robot-Control


Within this repository, you will find the comprehensive design of a robot controller specifically tailored for a 2-link robot arm. The controller is implemented and tested in both Gazebo and Matlab environments. The design process encompasses various stages, starting with a feedback linearization controller, followed by the integration of partial feedback linearization techniques. Additionally, robustness and adaptability aspects are incorporated into the controller design. The resulting control algorithm enables the robot arm to accurately track desired trajectories, even when confronted with dynamic model uncertainties. Furthermore, it ensures the arm's stabilization at the upward equilibrium point. Through these advancements, the controller exhibits superior performance and robustness, making it a valuable asset for effectively controlling the 2-link robot arm within simulated environments
